In the output, only include given concepts, relations and the triples in the given output format. The resulting graph should only contain concept nodes from the ontology and strictly follow the relations between concepts. Each triple and relations should appear only once. Don’t try to make up new concepts. \n\nCONTEXT:\nOntology Concepts: Organization, Reporting, TopicalStandard, Impact, Risks, Opportunities, Strategy, Actions, AdoptedPolicies, Targets \nOntology Relations:(Organization~hasReport~Reporting),(Reporting~discloses~TopicalStandard),(TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Impact),(TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Risks),(TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Opportunities),(TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Strategy),(TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Targets),(Strategy~contains~Actions),(Strategy~contains~AdoptedPolicies),(Reporting~hasName~list(string)),(Reporting~releaseDate~date),(Impact~hasDescription~list(string)),(Risks~hasDescription~list(string)),(Opportunities~hasDescription~list(string)),(Strategy~hasDescription~list(string)),(Actions~hasDescription~list(string)),(AdoptedPolicies~hasDescription~list(string)), (Target~hasDescription~list(string)) \nExample Sentence:  Siemens yearly report released for 2022 fiscal year. \nSustainability is a cornerstone of our “Strategy 2023”, the objectives for us are to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to well below 2°C. We plan to reduce the CO2 emissions of our own banking operations to net zero as early as 2040. \nOur targets are: to reduce emissions from business operations of Siemens without SHS by 55% by 2025 and 90% by 2030, and Net Zero operations by 2030 and supply chain by 2050. Landfill waste takes up space, generates greenhouse gas emissions, influences local biodiversity, and causes health problems for people and ecosystems. To mitigate the impact, in 2021 we adopted the Wastewater Management Policy and Policy on Waste Disposal. Where the environmentally sensitive use of energy is concerned, we deliberately go beyond the avoidance of emissions from power generation. Because even the generation of green electricity – for example, through the use of wind turbines or photovoltaics – has a negative impact on the environment since these systems have first to be manufactured, they change the local landscape when in operation, and they have to be disposed of at the end of their lifecycles. It is also vital for Siemens to identify and mitigate water risks, to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and to foster biodiversity. Society’s rising expectations for corporate environmental responsibility have not only led to stricter legal regulations, but have also opened up new business opportunities, such as take back and recycling of products. Our intensified use of life cycle assessments and environmental product declarations enables us to identify environmentally compatible design alternatives that take circularity into account and can be integrated into product specifications. Among other things, we will be applying the “Robust Eco Design” approach to all relevant products, systems, solutions, and services by 2030. \nExample Output:\nSiemens~hasReport~Reporting|Reporting~hasName~Siemens report 2022|Reporting~releaseDate~2023|Reporting~discloses~TopicalStandard|TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Impact|TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Risks|TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Opportunities|TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Strategy|TopicalStandard~hasAspect~Targets|Strategy~contains~Actions|Strategy~contains~AdoptedPolicies|Impact~hasDescription~Landfill waste leads to greenhouse gas emissions and influences local biodiversity\nUse of wind turbines or photovoltaics change local landscape and have to be disposed of|Risks~hasDescription~Emissions of volatile organic compounds into the water\nHealth problem for people and ecosystem|Opportunities~hasDescription~Robust Eco Design\nLyfecycle assessment\nEnvironmental product declaration|Strategy~hasDescription~”Strategy 2023” aims to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to well below 2°C|Actions~hasDescription~CO2 emissions reduction to net zero by 2040\nRobust Eco Design approach to all products by 2030|AdoptedPolicies~hasDescription~Wastewater Management Policy\nPolicy on Waste Disposal|Targets~hasDescription~Emission reduction without SHS by 55% by 2025 and 90% by 2030\nNet Zero operations by 2030 and supply chain by 2050.\n\nTest Sentence: {text})\nTest Output:"}
