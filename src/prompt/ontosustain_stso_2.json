    "prompt": "TASK:Given the following ontology and sentences, please extract the triples from the sentence according to the relations in the ontology. In the output, only include given concepts, relations and the triples in the given output format. The resulting graph should only contain concept nodes from the ontology and strictly follow the relations between concepts. Do not add any attributes that do not appear in the schema shown below. \n\nCONTEXT:\nOntology Concepts: Organization, Reporting, Impact, Risks, Opportunities, Strategy, Actions, Targets \nOntology Relations:(Organization~hasName~string),(Reporting~hasName~string),(Reporting~releaseDate~date),(Impact~hasDescription~string),(Risks~hasDescription~string),(Opportunities~hasDescription~string),(Strategy~hasDescriptiostn~string),(Actions~hasDescription~string),(Target~hasDescription~string)\nExample Sentence: Siemens yearly report released for 2022 fiscal year. \nDue to our strategic focus on electrification, automation, and digitalization, we offer our customers highly efficient and longlived products that fulfill their function over a long period of time and are especially dependent on electricity for their operation. Our electric motors, which are efficient and long-lived, are an important factor in use phase emissions. \nOur targets are: to reduce emissions from business operations of Siemens without SHS by 55% by 2025 and 90% by 2030, and Net Zero operations by 2030 and supply chain by 2050. \nThe use of biogas is another component of our decarbonization strategy, with which we have reduced our annual emissions by 19.6 thousand metric tons of CO2 compared to the use of conventional natural gas. We are working to reduce the emissions from our motor vehicle fleet, which comprises around 42,000 vehicles, and are striving to electrify it completely by 2030 as part of our EV100 commitment. We have increased the number of electric vehicles to around 1,360, and charging points to around 2,200. \n Landfill waste takes up space, generates greenhouse gas emissions, influences local biodiversity, and causes health problems for people and ecosystems. Where the environmentally sensitive use of energy is concerned, we deliberately go beyond the avoidance of emissions from power generation. Because even the generation of green electricity – for example, through the use of wind turbines or photovoltaics – has a negative impact on the environment since these systems have first to be manufactured, they change the local landscape when in operation, and they have to be disposed of at the end of their lifecycles. Society’s rising expectations for corporate environmental responsibility have not only led to stricter legal regulations, but have also opened up new business opportunities, such as take back and recycling of products. Our intensified use of life cycle assessments and environmental product declarations enables us to identify environmentally compatible design alternatives that take circularity into account and can be integrated into product specifications.
